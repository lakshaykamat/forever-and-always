# ðŸ’– Our Love Timer

This is not just a timer â€” it's a heartbeat.  
It counts the moments since **April 25, 2025 at 11:30 PM** â€”  
when our forever began. âœ¨

Every second that passes is a reminder of how much you mean to me.  
Every minute is a quiet whisper: _I love you._  
Every hour is a thank-you for being mine.  
And every day is proof that true love only grows stronger.

This little page is my way of saying â€”  
I never stop thinking about us.  
About how lucky I am.  
About how beautiful it is to love and be loved by you.

> _"Forever is not long enough when it's with you."_ ðŸ’•

With all my love,  
**Yours, always.**
